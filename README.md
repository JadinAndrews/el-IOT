# el-IOT
A simple framework with advanced functions for creating things with the SIM900 family of GSM/GPRS shields and breakouts.

This is a framework I decided to work on after creating a few functions to interface with a SIM900 GSM unit. 
It started out as a water meter project, but it is going to turn into a framework as I get time to organise things.
For now, the best way to see what this library is capable of is to read the comments inside the basic water meter example.

Please note, this project is in a state of extreme infancy, I do not care if or how you use my code, just understand that
I do not gaurauntee everything works. 

I especially do not expect anyone to find this, but hope you find it useful... ;)
